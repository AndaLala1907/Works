A collection of projects where I experiment, build, and refine my skills in front-end and full-stack development. Organized for easy navigation, this repo reflects my passion for coding and innovation.


# OVERVIEW
# HTML/CSS-Project Branch
The Technology Fair Website is a fully responsive platform designed to provide an engaging experience for event attendees across all devices. Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SASS, the site features key sections like event details, an interactive schedule, speaker profiles, and a user-friendly registration form with JavaScript validation. Additionally, a dynamic countdown timer creates anticipation for the event. The combination of modern front-end technologies ensures a visually appealing and seamless user experience, offering a comprehensive solution for event organizers and attendees alike.

# StreetARTist-Project Branch
The StreetARTist project is an interactive web application that uses the JSONPlaceholder API to manage artist profiles and visitor interactions. Users can join as either visitors or artists. A dropdown menu displays a list of registered artists, and selecting an artist shows their total sold items, total income, and a dynamic Chart.js graph comparing the sold prices to original prices of their artworks. Artists have full control over their profiles, allowing them to add, edit, and delete their artworks through an intuitive navigation bar. The app provides an engaging and data-driven experience for both artists and visitors, making it easy to explore and manage art sales and artist profiles.

The project follows a clean and scalable architecture, ensuring maintainability and flexibility. With a focus on delivering a seamless user experience, the application provides smooth navigation and consistent performance across all pages, offering visitors easy access to key information about the company's offerings.
